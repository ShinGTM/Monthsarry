    <b>Hello my dear mabyy</b>,I don't even know if formal ba sasabihin ko na medyo casual but here it is.
    mabyy, kamusta school mo? kamusta ka? are you goods po ba? <b>67</b>, miss na kits hehe,  okay game. It was definitely a unexpected relationship but despite everything seems to be doing quite well and happy for that, There's nothing I could provide right now so I coded again to make our monthsarry special, I really love you mabyy, yuini, c*, I really love you that you can't even fathom it and valentine is coming and really don't know what to do,  at this point narealize kona bat parang nag rrant ako, okay na yan. I'm really happy that you came into my life, it was definitely a new experience for me and I'm grateful for that and I hope many months will come for us— an eternal flame for US.<b> I love you so much mabyyy, mwuahhh. </b>

    Yours truly,<br>
